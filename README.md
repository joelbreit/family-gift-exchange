# Family Gift Exchange Web App

## Overview

The Family Gift Exchange Web App is a full-stack application designed to modernize and simplify the process of organizing my family gift exchange. Developed with React, Reactstrap, and AWS, this app offers an intuitive user experience for my family to manage their gift-giving activities efficiently.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure login system to access personal gift exchange information.
-   **Wishlist Directory**: Members can view wishlists and gift ideas of other participants.
-   **Serverless Backend**: Utilizing AWS Lambda functions for handling backend logic.

## Motivation

This project was created as a practical solution to bring a digital twist to my family's holiday gift exchange. It served as a platform for me to apply my knowledge in React, Reactstrap, and serverless technologies while creating something valuable and enjoyable for my family to use.
